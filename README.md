# Fake-News-Detection

Fake news detection
The ability to distinguish between reliable news stories and deliberate hoaxes or sarcastic news has become increasingly important with the spread of such information over social media networks. Big tech and social media companies are particularly interested in the reliability of content being disseminated on their platforms. These platforms would ideally like to be able to detect and flag articles suspected of being so-called “fake news” automatically.

The main objective of this project is to filter fake news from real news, using NLP and at the end a deep learning model, just to show in comparison that, in NLP it is not necessary that deep learning gives a higher accurace.
